## Go WHMCS API

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/bradberger/gowhmcs?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/bradberger/gowhmcs)

Go bindings for use with the WHMCS external API. Right now, the various API
calls are being added on an as-needed basis, but PR's are most welcome.

The project is very much in the earliest of beginning stages, so if you want
to use it expect to get your hands dirty.

High priorities are adding unit tests and filling out the API a bit more.
